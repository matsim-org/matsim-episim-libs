	// take from wikipedia
	// RR â‰ˆ OR / ( 1 - RC + (RC * OR) )
	//with RR relative risk, OR odds ratio, RC base risk.  Base risk is reported as 17.4% ("no face mask").  With this:
	//
	//across all masks: OR=0.15, RR = 0.176
	//
	//surgical/cloth masks: OR=0.33, RR = 0.37
	//
	//N95 masks: OR=0.04, RR = 0.048
	//
	//The values for N95 vs. surgical/cloth are hidden in some footnote of some table.
	//
	// This gives support for the numbers we use, but it is not very readable.
